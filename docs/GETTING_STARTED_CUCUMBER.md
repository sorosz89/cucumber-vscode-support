# Getting Started with Cucumber and VS Code

This learning module will guide you on how to start working with Cucumber using Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code: An open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It is highly extensible and customizable.
- [Cucumber for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CucumberOpen.cucumber-official) plugin: It provides syntax highlighting, snippets, and other useful features for Cucumber.

## Setup

**Step 1:** Download and Install Visual Studio Code

If you haven't installed VS Code, visit the [official download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and follow the instructions.

**Step 2:** Install Cucumber for Visual Studio Code Plugin

To install the Cucumber for Visual Studio Code plugin, follow these steps:

1. Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions view (press `Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
2. Search for 'Cucumber' in the Marketplace search box.
3. Find 'Cucumber for Visual Studio Code' by [cucumber.io](https://cucumber.io/) in the search results and click on the Install button.

**Step 3:** Clone and Set Up the Project

Clone the 'cucumber-vscode-support' repository and install the dependencies by following the installation instructions provided in the README file.

## Explore and Learn

With the setup completed, you are ready to explore the project and start learning Cucumber. Here's what you can do:

- Open the feature files in VS Code and take a look at the syntax highlighting provided by the Cucumber plugin.
- Write and run your first test: Create a new `.feature` file and write a small feature in Gherkin, Cucumber's domain-specific language. Then run it using the command `npm test`.

Don't forget to check out the official [Cucumber Documentation](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/10-minute-tutorial/) to learn more about writing feature files and step definitions.
